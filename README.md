## Meeting alerter

Prevent Zoom bombs while WFH using this tool to indicate when meetings are going on!

This script works with Blink1Control2 (v 2.2.3 tested on Mac) and lights up when the camera is active, and turns off when it's not. So no more Zoom bombs (unless on purpose!).

Steps to use:
1. Download and install https://blink1.thingm.com/blink1control/
2. Open event sources and add new event source - select Add Script.
3. Give path to this script, change interval to 2 seconds and parse output as JSON.
4. PROFIT!
